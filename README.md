# Portfolio

Hello!

Welcome to my Portfolio. I am in the middle of organizing, adding, and removing certain past projects here. I am also working on adding explanations on what each of these projects entailed.

I have recently finished up work on a project that I have been working on for a while. This project involved taking a dataset from Kaggle that contained Summer Sales of Clothes from Wish.com, an eCommerce platform. I set out to model future unit sales for the Summer of 2021. I used Jupyter Notebooks and SQL very heavily in this project. Please find the work that I did attached below.

For future reference, SalatBuddy is the name of a startup company. I have been practicing my Data Science skills on the data from exports from the company's Shopify account and it's Amazon account. Any data that is presented will have customer info stripped from it and will have been approved for public viewing by the company. If you have any questions and want to contact me then please reach out to me at NaasirHaleem2020@u.northwestern.edu.
