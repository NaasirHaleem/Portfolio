# Portfolio

Hello!

Welcome to my Portfolio. I am in the middle of organizing, adding, and removing certain past projects here. I am also working on adding explanations on what each of these projects entailed.

Please find my most recent project that I completed, the Chicago Neighborhood Segmentation, in the associated branch. In this project I used KMeans Clustering in order to segment the different 72 Chicago Neighborhoods by Demographic Data, Economic Indicators, and Venue Information. I separated the neighborhoods into 7 distinct bins so that it would be easier to identify the differences between them. The use case for this project would ideally be for both government and non-government organizations to be able to identify neighborhoods that are in Critical Need of assistance and also understand the nuanced approaches required in order to benefit these communities. 

Another project that I finished was a modeling activity that I did Summer Sales of Clothes for Wish.com, an eCommerce platform. I set out to model future unit sales for the Summer of 2021. I used Jupyter Notebooks and SQL very heavily in this project. Please find the work that I did attached in it's own branch.

For future reference, SalatBuddy is the name of a startup company. I have been practicing my Data Science skills on the data from exports from the company's Shopify account and it's Amazon account. Any data that is presented will have customer info stripped from it and will have been approved for public viewing by the company. If you have any questions and want to contact me then please reach out to me at NaasirHaleem2020@u.northwestern.edu.
