Portfolio of Data Science work

Hello!

Welcome to my Portfolio. I am in the middle of organizing, adding, and removing certain past projects here. I am still in the middle of working on some of these projects so they may appear unfinished themselves. Specifically, SalatBuddy is the name of a startup company. I have been practicing my Data Science skills on the data from exports from the company's Shopify account and it's Amazon account. Any data that is presented will have customer info stripped from it and will have been approved for public viewing by the company. If you have any questions and want to contact me then please reach out to me at NaasirHaleem2020@u.northwestern.edu.
