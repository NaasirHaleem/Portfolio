This process works by creating centroid points that are determined by the data that most closely surrounds that point. Since I am using 5 different socioeconomic factors, along with longitude and latitude, the centroid points will help to bin the different neighborhoods. I have chosen to use 7 of these points."

This should help me to determine how disadvantaged communities are affected in relation to the venues that are most present within them. For a policy maker, or a non-profit organization, this could help determine what resources should be leveraged in these communities."

The Per Capita Income, which again is the aggregate income of the neighborhood divided by the total population, is around $25000. The household poverty rate is around 16%. In totality I would peg Cluster 0 as being a Middle Class neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Additional Observations </b> \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cluster 0 is certainly extremely diverse. The percent of Blacks, Whites, and Latinos is all between 24% and 38%.  Asians make up the final ~8% of the population. I think that this is supported by observing the sorted venues in the neighborhoods. Many different ethnic specific restaurants are represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It is important to note that the percentage of Children or Retirement Age Adults is fairly high. More than a third of the population falls into this category. This probably does mean that the average family here is young with children.\n",

    "<b> Cluster Definition </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 0 can be defined as being Diverse, Middle Class, and Young\n",

    "<b> Analysis:</b> There are similarities between Cluster 1 and Cluster 0. Both clusters have Per Capita Income that is within $8000 of each other. The Non-GED numbers and Unemployment Rate also seem to be in line with one another. Additionally, both clusters can be found throughout the city and aren't necessarily geographically constrained. However, it is clear that by several metrics, Cluster 1 has more clear instances of greater community hardship than Cluster 0. For this reason, I would label Cluster 1 as being Lower/Middle Class.\n",

    "1. Cluster 1 is predominately Black, with Hispanics or Latinos making up the other significant ethnicity in the neighborhood.\n",

    "2. Similarily to Cluster 0, the Percent of Children or Retired Adults is fairly high as compared to other neighborhoods. \n",

    "# Cluster 2 Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Analysis: </b> It is immediately apparent that Cluster 2 is substantially different than Cluster 0 and Cluster 1. The Per Capita Income is around $62000 and the Unemployment Rate is extremely low at around 5 percent. There is also significant geographic restraint in play, as neighborhoods that fall into Cluster 2 are close to the lake and are for the most part in the northern side of the city. Cluster 2 can be characterized as Upper Class.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Additional Analysis </b>: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The demographics of Cluster 2 swing heavily toward Whites, who make up 72 percent of the Cluster. Blacks, Asians, Hispanics or Latinos, encompass the other 28 percent at a relatively similar rate. This is backed up by a noted lack of ethnic restaurants making up the venues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cluster 2 has the highest rate of working age adults at almost 80 percent of the population. These are also educated individuals where 95 percent have at least a GED. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Cluster Definition: </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "I would define Cluster 2 as North Side, Professional, and White"

    "<b> Analysis: </b> Cluster 5 is probably the most interesting of any of these clusters. Cluster 5 is at a significant lack of resources. The Per Capita Income is $6000 less than the next lowest Per Capita Income of any neighborhood. The cluster is also extremely geographically constrained. In fact, it seems that there are pockets of the city where these neighborhoods lie next to one another. It would be to the interest of the city to direct substantial resources to neighborhoods within this cluster. Cluster 5 are most definitely in Critical Need.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Additional Analysis: </b> \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Blacks largely comprise this cluster, as do Hispanics or Latinos. Additionally, it is concerning that Fast Food Restaurants are so present within these communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Not only is the Unemployment Rate extremely high, the Percent of Working Age Adults is relatively low. This probably does indicate that even if there are many children within this Cluster, the families are plagued by unemployment.\n",

    "I believe that it is clear to see from analysis of these different clusters that Chicago is indeed highly segregated, which can particularly be seen in the difference between North Chicago and South Chicago. Specific parts of North Chicago are White, Upper Class, and Professional. This does not necessarily remain true for South Chicago. It should also be noted that the neighborhoods of mainly Black and Hispanic or Latino individuals are significantly more underserved than their counterparts. This is true in both terms of the unemployment rate within these neighborhoods, as well as the venues that are present. I think with further analysis of these neighborhoods public officials will be able to more effectively serve the communities under their jurisdiction."
